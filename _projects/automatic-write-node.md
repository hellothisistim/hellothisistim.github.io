<a itemprop="url" href="http://www.nukepedia.com/written-tutorials/how-to-build-an-automatic-write-node" target="_blank">This tutorial</a> was written to share a technique for automatically naming outputs in the compositing package <a href="https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke" target="_blank">Nuke</a>. Using this technique has saved me countless hours and I am happy to contribute it to [the community of Nuke artists](http://www.nukepedia.com) that has so generously shared their own techniques with me.
