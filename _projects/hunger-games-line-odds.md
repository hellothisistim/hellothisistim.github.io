In these shots from The Hunger Games, the odds board shows basic stats and current odds for each of the tributes. The changing odds were plot points during the last part of the film.

The board was created entirely in post production, following a template from the production’s art department. Each pixel in the fictional 2K display is made up of four simulated LEDs, one each of red, green, blue, and white. The tributes’ portraits were shown using a scanline technique inspired by the phosphor pattern on a Trinitron video monitor. The display has a glass panel front, which reflects its environment. Display simulation, text animation, and compositing were all handled in Nuke. The wide shot (top) is the only shot that contains a photographed plate. The rest is entirely artificial.
