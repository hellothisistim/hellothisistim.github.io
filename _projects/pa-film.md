<p class="subhead">Made at Shooters Post and Transfer (now <a href="http://www.alkemy-x.com/" target="_blank">Alkemy X</a>)<br/>
Video duration: 5&prime; 12&Prime;</p>
<meta itemprop="duration" content="T5M12S" />

<p about>This video was made by a team of designers, animators, and editors at Shooters to increase support for the Pennsylvania film tax credit. Following an established storyboard and color palette, illustrations were generated and animated to clearly explain how film tax credits work and how they have been used.</p>
