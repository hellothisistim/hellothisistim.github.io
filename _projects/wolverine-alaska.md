<p class="subhead">Made at <a href="http://rsp.com.au/" target="_blank">Rising Sun Pictures</a> for <a href="http://www.foxmovies.com/" target="_blank">Twentieth Century Fox</a></p>

For this digital matte painting (DMP) shot in The Wolverine, my job was to integrate a beautiful painting by <a href="http://www.damienthaller.com.au/" target="_blank">Damien Thaller</a> into the plate, which was shot in New South Wales, Australia. It was necessary to “re-dress” the Australian location to look like Alaska, where this scene takes place. Crowds were removed from the plate and architectural details and signs were modified. Features of the distant street were projected onto 3D cards to create the necessary parallax. A seamless blend between the set and the painting was essential.
