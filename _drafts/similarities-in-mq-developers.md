I have a copy of the Darkroom Cookbook by Steve Anchell, and I'm not afraid to use it. It's been incredibly useful as I dive back into darkroom photography. 

One of my recent uses for it is supremely geeky. Let's lay a bit of groundwork as I explain.

Developers are made up of four basic components: developing agent, activator, restrainer, and preservative. The developing agent converts silver halides to metallic silver. Developing agents work best in an alkaline environment, so photo chemists use an activator to keep the PH high and the halide-to-metallic-silver process moving along. The restrainer is there to keep the developing agents focused on the latent image. Left to their own devices, the developing agents will reduce all the silver halide to metallic silver, even the silver halides that didn’t get any exposure. So the restrainer helps keep the white parts of the picture white while the black parts get black. The preservative is there for the same reason as in processed food. It keeps the developer fresh longer.

I was perusing the formulas for metol-hydroquinone (MQ) developers because, well, I have a stock of metol and hydroquinone left over from an earlier foray into mixing my own chemistry. I was looking for a developer that was lower in contrast and/or created warmer tones than Kodak Dektol. I found Defender 55D. It’s sort of half-way between Dektol and Selectol and uses the same chemical components.

For a while I was mixing up both Dektol and Defender 55D. Dektol was for developing paper negatives and Defender 55D worked great with Fomatone, a warm tone paper. But that got old quickly. The
