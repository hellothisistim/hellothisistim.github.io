For about the last six months, I have been testing my own special developer formula which I call MQ Base. It is a flexible MQ (based on metol and hydroquinone) developer in three stock solutions. The solutions can be combined in different ratios to create several different working strength developers. The current developers are Kodak D-72 (a.k.a. Dektol), Kodak D-52 (a.k.a. Selectol), Defender 55D, and SA Warm-tone (from photographer Steve Anchell.)

First lets have a look at 


Developers are made up of four basic components: developing agent, preservative, activator, and restrainer. Here’s what each of them contributes:

The developing agent turns the invisible silver halides in a photographic emulsion into visible, metallic silver. The four most common developing agents are metal, hydroquinone, phenidone, and ascorbic acid. 

Developing agents like to oxidize. Oxidizing makes them not work. It happens as a normal part of the development process. But it also happens when the developer is stored in the bottle waiting to be used. To avoid this, we include a preservative to minimize oxidation.

Developing agents work best in an alkaline environment, so photo chemists include the activator to keep the PH high and the halide-to-metallic-silver process moving along. 


The restrainer is there to keep the developing agents focused on the latent image. Left to their own devices, the developing agents will reduce all the silver halide to metallic silver, even the silver halides that didn’t get any exposure. This is bad. So the restrainer keeps the white parts of the picture white while the black parts get black. 


I was perusing the formulas for metol-hydroquinone (MQ) developers because, well, I have a stock of metol and hydroquinone left over from an earlier foray into mixing my own chemistry. I was looking for a developer that was lower in contrast and/or created warmer tones than Kodak Dektol. I found Defender 55D. It’s sort of half-way between Dektol and Selectol and uses the same chemical components.

For a while I was mixing up both Dektol and Defender 55D. Dektol was for developing paper negatives and Defender 55D worked great with Fomatone, a warm tone paper. But that got old quickly. The
