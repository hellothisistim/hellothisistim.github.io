"The question: 'What was _really_ there?' becomes as irrelevant as what Monet's lily pond _really_ looked like to Mme. Monet when she rode by on her bicycle." (Hess, 1965)

"Siskind has written: 'It makes no difference what the subject matter is. the idea, the statement, is the only thing that counts... I care only for people--I'm interested only in human destiny. It just happens that I work symbolically--not directly with people as subjects ... Perhaps it is that the forms, the shapes (in signs) communicate more, and are more important than what was originally said on them.'" (Smith, 1965)
