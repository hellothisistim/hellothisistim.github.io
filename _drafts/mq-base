A common-denominator MQ developer

plug the Darkroom Cookbook

What are MQ developers?

Dektol, Selectol, and Defender 55D (three MQ developers) have the same proportion of metol, hydroquinone, and sodium sulfite.

First, factor out the common component quantities so we have a stock with the minimum metol, sodium sulfite, hydroquinone, carbonate, and bromide. This gets augmented with more carbonate and/or bromide according to which developer it's being.

Okay, so now what happens if we eliminate the carbonate and bromide entirely?
  Shelf life okay. (At least 3 months)
  Enables divided development
  Still flexible
