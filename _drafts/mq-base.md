A three-part photographic paper developer based on metol and hydroquinone (MQ). Add varying amounts of water, carbonate, and bromide to make tray-strength Kodak D-72 (Dektol), Kodak D-52 (Selectol), or Defender 55D (a warmtone developer) from a single stock solution. Having the accelerator (carbonate) separate means it can also be used for divided development. 

## Stock solutions

Prepare these three stock solutions: MQ Base, 6% carbonate, 10% bromide. Dissolving the components in warm water is not strictly necessary, but it does speed up the process. A liter of MQ Base stock keeps for at least 3 months in brown glass.

*MQ Base*  
Distilled water at 125F/52C: 800ml  
Metol:                         3g  
Sodium sulfite, anhydrous: 45g  
Hydroquinone: 12g  
Distilled water to make: 1000ml  


*6% carbonate solution*  
Distilled water 750ml  
Sodium carbonate, monohydrated:	60g  
Distilled water to make 1000ml  

*10% bromide solution*  
Distilled water: 400ml  
Potassium bromide, anhydrous: 50g  
Distilled water to make: 500ml  

## Working strength dilutions

MQ Base can be mixed to be any of the following developers: Kodak D-72 (Dektol), Kodak D-52 (Selectol), or Defender 55D. I have also included an approximation of Steve Anchell's SA Warm-tone developer, as published in The Variable Contrast Printing Manual.

*D-72 (Dektol)*  
MQ Base stock: 333ml
6% carbonate: 444ml
10% bromide: 7ml
Distilled water: 216ml

To make 1 liter of working strength D-52 (Selectol):
MQ Base stock: 	167ml
6% carbonate:	95ml
10% bromide:	5ml
Distilled water:	733ml

To make 1 liter of working strength Defender 55D:
MQ Base stock:	278ml
6% carbonate:	250ml
10% bromide:	43ml
Distilled water:	429ml


To make 1 liter of working strength SA Warm-tone:
		As 1:1 dilution	As 1:3 dilution
	MQ Base stock:	250ml	125ml
	6% carbonate:	127.5ml	64ml
	10% bromide:	5ml	3ml
	Distilled water:	617.5ml	808ml
Note: This is not an exact match for Anchellâ€™s SA Warm-tone. SA Warmtone has a teensy bit more hydroquinone (4.2 grams per gram of metol) than MQ Base (4.0 grams per gram of metol.) In 1:1 working solution, this difference amounts to 5%  less hydroquinone.

A common-denominator MQ developer

plug the Darkroom Cookbook

What are MQ developers?

Dektol, Selectol, and Defender 55D (three MQ developers) have the same proportion of metol, hydroquinone, and sodium sulfite.

First, factor out the common component quantities so we have a stock with the minimum metol, sodium sulfite, hydroquinone, carbonate, and bromide. This gets augmented with more carbonate and/or bromide according to which developer it's being.

Okay, so now what happens if we eliminate the carbonate and bromide entirely?
  Shelf life okay. (At least 3 months)
  Enables divided development
  Still flexible
