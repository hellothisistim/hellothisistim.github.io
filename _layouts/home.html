	<p>I come back to photography after working as a visual effects artist. For two decades I manipulated moving images for film and television. Photography meant film when I learned to do it, and when I left, it was still mostly chemical. Now that I'm back, I find that the interesting parts are chemical again. I return to the darkroom with a refined eye and a deep understanding of the manipulation made possible by digital tools.</p>
