Today I'm looking at images from (The Mobile Darkroom)[https://www.themobiledarkroom.ca], a project by Shane Arsenault and Natalia Barberis. They're shooting (Harman Direct Positive)[https://www.ilfordphoto.com/harman-direct-positive-paper-sheets] in a 16x20 view camera. 

Arsenault and Barberis have me thinking about scene reproduction. Specifically, how important is it to maintain image detail through a wide range of subject brightnesses?

Spend some time with their images. They're beautiful.
