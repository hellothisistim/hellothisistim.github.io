[![Ducts, a silver-gelatin photograph by Tim Bowman]( {{ "/assets/photographs/ducts/ducts.jpg" | relative_url }})](https://hellothisistim.com/photographs/ducts)

I'm so pleased to announce that [Don't Take Pictures](http://www.donttakepictures.com/gallery-structure/) has selected my photograph, [Ducts](https://hellothisistim.com/photographs/ducts), for their Structure exhibition  on their web site. 

> Most of us spend the majority of our days inside of buildings. More than strictly shelters, the architectural styles and details of buildings show different geographic, cultural, and historic aspects of our world. From institutions of learning to places of worship; residential dwellings or the workplace; inhabited or abandoned, for this exhibition, Donâ€™t Take Pictures presents photographs of architecture from around the world.

The collected work is really great and I'm proud to be included. There's also a lot of urban landscape in there, and that really gets my motor running.

[The exhibition](http://www.donttakepictures.com/gallery-structure/) is up through 21 August 2018.
