This morning brought an interesting project by [Douglas Stockdale](https://www.douglasstockdale.com/index). He's made a book of photographs shot out the window of his car. Yes, normally, that'd be yawn-inducing. But in this case, the photographs are fascinating and I feel a sort of kinship in his consideration of mundane manufactured landscape. Also, his titles are really nice. It's too easy to get weird when titling this kind of quiet work. Stockdale keeps them feeling grounded even when he's talking about big stuff.

[Aline Smithson has a great writeup on the book](http://lenscratch.com/2018/07/douglas-stockdale-middle-ground/), entitled Middle Ground, over at [LENSCRATCH](http://lenscratch.com). Go see the photographs and the presentation of the book, which is one continuous, fan-folded sheet. 

Stockdale is represented by [Fabrik Projects](http://fabrikprojects.com/portfolio-item/douglas-stockdale/) in Los Angeles, USA.
