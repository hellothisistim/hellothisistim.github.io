I’m looking forward to tomorrow’s [Digital Media Symposium](https://web.archive.org/web/20141020161704/http://digm.drexel.edu/acelab/2014/10/18/digital-media-symposium-october-24/) (link courtesy of [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/)) at Drexel University. I’m presenting some recent work and VFX industry advice at 2pm.
