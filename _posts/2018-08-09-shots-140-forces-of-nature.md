Can't even believe it. This is my photograph, [Annular Eclipse, 22 September 2017](https://hellothisistim.com/photographs/annular-eclipse), on the cover of the most recent [Shots](https://shotsmag.com/), issue number 140, entitled _Forces of Nature_.

Shots is a special magazine. It’s like nothing else on the newsstand. The publishers don’t give a damn about how well known your name is or what equipment you use. They just look for and publish good black and white photographs in the best, most affordable way they can.

A year-long subscription (four issues) costs 29 bucks. 

Your subscription entitles you to submit up to 8 images to each issue for free. Compare that to the submission fee for the last contest you entered. [You should subscribe now.](https://shotsmag.com/collections/subscriptions) Don’t even wait to finish reading this post.

Shots has been around for over 30 years. It was originally a weirdly large, single-color, newsprint magazine. Dan Price, the founding publisher, published it out of the tipi where he lived. Dan would publish the photos along with whatever envelope they arrived in so you could contact the photographer if you wanted to. This was all pre-internet, you see. A much younger me used to look at the issues on magazine rack at Tower Books on South Street in Philadelphia. I would often bring them home for longer contemplation.
