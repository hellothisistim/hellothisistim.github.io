[![Annular Eclipse, 22 September 2017 on the cover of Shots #140]( {{ "/assets/photographs/ducts/FFFF.jpg" | relative_url }})](https://hellothisistim.com/photographs/annular-eclipse)

Can't even beieve it. This is my photograph, Annular Eclipse, 22 September 2017, on the cover of the most recent [Shots](https://shotsmag.com/) issue, number 140, entitled _Forces of Nature_.

Shots has been around for a while. It was originally pubished as a weirdly large, single-color, newsprint magazine out of the tipi where Dan Price, the founding publisher, lived. Dan would publish the photos along with whatever envelope they arrived in so you could contact the photographer if you wanted to. This was all pre-internet, you see. A much younger me used to look at the issues on magazine rack at Tower Books on South Street in Philadelphia. I think I even sent him something at one point, but I never got anything published.
