All of these photographs were found in the course of other activities. None of it is set up. The world is endlessly giving. All you have to do is pay attention. 

Signs of Life has the heart of a zine and the jacket of a library book. Here, I (mis)use digital printing technology to present everyday images from my life. It is possibly the most neatly presented zine in the world, unless the book-making robot goofs and glues pages together willy-nilly or sticks a bit of fuzz under the cover. It’s been known to happen.

Signs of Life is a 6 by 9 inch linen-wrapped hardbound book containing 72 black and white images. It is printed in one pass of black ink on 148 pages of 60-pound cream paper. The cover is grey and the title and author are stamped in white on the spine. Each copy is signed and numbered on the title page.
