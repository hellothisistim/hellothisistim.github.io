Pear Trees, 2016.
Lumen print on Agfa Portriga. 8x10 inches.

This photograph was a bit of an experiment to see if I could make a [lumen exposure](http://masteringphoto.com/photographic-alternative-processes-lumen-prints/) through a lens instead of as a contact print. The camera sat out in the yard all day (photo below), and in the end I did get an image. It was faint, but it was definitely there.
