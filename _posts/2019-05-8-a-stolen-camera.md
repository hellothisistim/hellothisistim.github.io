The camera I learned to make photographs with was not mine. It belonged to my [dad](http://bowco.com/). And it got stolen from my apartment---along with a nice collection of his lenses--—two weeks after I moved to Philly. That hurt. It was a sweet, silver SRT-101. Dad had bought it around the time I was born and he always brought it with him. I got this camera as a replacement.

I took most of the following pictures with it. Except for the weird ones. Those are from a plastic camera, contact print of a magazine page, and my first homemade wooden pinhole camera. I’ll let you figure out which is which. The last one was my favorite photograph from the early 90s. I poached it from the nuns’ garden at [Tyler School of Art](https://tyler.temple.edu/#/prospective). This is back in the day, before Tyler moved onto the Temple main campus. We were supposed to stay out of there, but they had statuary, I was a gloomy kid, and well, you only live once.
