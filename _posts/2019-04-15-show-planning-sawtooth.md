![Planning the gallery layout with tiny prints](/assets/posts/{{ page.path | split: "/" | last | split: "." | first }}/sawtooth-layingOutTheShow.jpg)

Jessica caught me playing with tiny versions of my big prints tonight. I'm planning the layout of my show in the Redding Corridor Gallery at [Sawtooth School for Visual Art](https://www.sawtooth.org/) this August. Too many moving parts to arrange the prints on the computer, so I'm pushing these little guys around until they sit well together. 

These photographs are all from the Winston-Salem project. I’ve been documenting buildings in low-traffic areas of my adopted home town. You’d be surprised how much things change. A few of these subjects no longer exist. That number could go up by August. 

Thank you to [Jessica Singerman](https://www.jessicasingerman.com/) for the photo.
