> But I feel it’s necessary for someone to document the realities.”

[Malek Bigum](https://www.instagram.com/malekbigum/), from his Ilford [#MyFilmStrory](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MyFilmStory).

That’s an interesting, thorny question. How *should* we balance privacy with historical documentation? I won’t even try to answer, because in the very next quote Bigum explains his stance against manufactured perfection in a way that is, for me, absolute perfection.

See it for yourself.
