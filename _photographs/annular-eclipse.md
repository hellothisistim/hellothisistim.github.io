Annular Eclipse, 22 September 2017.

Silver gelatin print. 4" x 5"

I so enjoyed seeing the moon change the typically round shape of the sun during the 21 August eclipse this year that I thought I might try to replicate the effect in miniature. This print is made using a reversal paper and is the paper-negative equivalent to a tintype. Like a tintype, this print is unique. The same piece of paper shown here was in the camera for the exposure and was rendered as a positive. I was initially disppointed by the mottled tones, but after trying again using a differnet developer I liked the mystery better than the perfection.
