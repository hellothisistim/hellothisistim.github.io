I do not make photographs, I go out and hunt them. With an 8x10 camera it takes planning. Have to put yourself in the right place at the right time. Have to get your head right so you can see the world in the right way. Sometimes it feels like I'm aligning the orbits of celestial bodies. Conscious thought is the enemy. Occasionally I get it right. Then I have to do it again in the darkroom. I keep focused on doing the work and trust that good things will happen in the process. They do.
