I always wonder what’s going to happen when I’m out making photographs and see someone approaching. The big, antique view camera disarms a lot of folks, but I’m still pointing a camera at their place like I was this morning. Some folks could take offense. But I had a really nice conversation with the gentleman. He noticed me out here when he opened the store and came out for a chat. He and his wife run the grocery. Stepping through their door is to step back in time. I’m glad they’re there.

Edition of 2 with 1 artist proof. Silver gelatin print on glossy, fiber-based paper. First printing. 8 by 10 inch image on 11 by 14 inch paper. Selenium toned for longevity. Signed, with date and edition information on the verso.
