The solar eclipse of August 21, 2017 inspired me to create this sequence of cyanotype prints. While I was making them, I was also thinking about the thousands of amazing photographs of our solar system taken by space-traveling robots as they voyage away from Earth. 

The cyanotype process is one of the oldest, and is certainly the simplest, photographic processes. To make these prints, I brought coated papers to the beach and used the sun and sand to make my exposures. Then I developed them in the ocean. In terms of process, itâ€™s the simplest thing in the world. But doing that simple thing on a windy beach and in the crashing waves brought a lot of fantastic randomness to the resulting prints.
