The Cold Warehouse, Trade Street

It was a beautiful June day, late afternoon. The sun was starting to sink, but in no danger of hitting the horizon any time soon. The kind of slow blend of afternoon into evening that we get in the summer. Feeling doubly beautiful because I had no obligation to be anywhere until dinnertime.

Sold out edition of 1 with 1 artist proof. Silver gelatin print on glossy, fiber-based paper. First printing. 8 by 10 inch image on 11 by 14 inch paper. Selenium toned for longevity. Signed, with date, edition information, and title on the verso.
