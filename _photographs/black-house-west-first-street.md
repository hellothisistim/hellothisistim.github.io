Black House, West First Street.

The side of this building is impossibly dense. So many lines and shapes and textures, indicating changing uses, needs, and requirements. I believe it's a mix of residential and commercial, but I wouldn't want to hazard a guess about which part is which.

First printing. Edition of 2 with 1 artist proof. Glossy, silver gelatin fiber-based paper. 8 by 10 inch image on 11 by 14 inch paper. Selenium toned for longevity.

Print number one of the first printing is available now. $100 includes free shipping via USPS Priority within the US. Please email me for shipping outside the US.
