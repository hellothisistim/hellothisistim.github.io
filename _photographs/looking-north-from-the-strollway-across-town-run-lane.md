Walking with my camera on the strollway above Winston-Salem one early overcast  morning, I was struck by the contrast of old and new. Lots of old things are becoming new downtown. The changing texture has me thinking about how best to honor the past while creating the future. 

That massive sign also has me wondering just how frustrating it must be to defend a tiny collection of centrally placed parking spaces in this town. It must be brutal.
