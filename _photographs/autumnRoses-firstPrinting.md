Autumn Roses, 2017.

Silver gelatin print on glossy fiber paper, polysulfide toned.
First printing. Edition of four. 4" x 5" image on 7" x 8" paper.

$50.

One of the fun things about paper negatives is that the grey tones they make have practically no relation to how the subject looks with my eyes. Believe it or not, these roses were very red. The paper I use cannot see red at all, but it does see ultraviolet. This led to a lovely surprise in the darkroom.
