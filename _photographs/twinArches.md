This negative sat in a box for a year because I was too wrapped up in technical perfection to acknowledge the value of documentation.

My son and I went to the celebration on Happy Hill when the arch finally came together on a long-awaited day of celebration. There were a lot of cameras there, but we definitely had the oldest one. Many thanks to Rising Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church in Happy Hills for welcoming us that beautiful day.
