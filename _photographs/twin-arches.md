On the day the Twin Arches were assembled, my son and I went to the celebration in Happy Hills. There were [a lot of cameras there](http://www.journalnow.com/gallery/twin-arches-are-raised-on-us-and-the-salem-connector/collection_17d436a2-a91d-11e6-a7d3-ab218537acd1.html#7), but we [definitely had the oldest one](http://www.journalnow.com/gallery/twin-arches-are-raised-on-us-and-the-salem-connector/collection_17d436a2-a91d-11e6-a7d3-ab218537acd1.html#15 "Twin Arches are Raised on US 52 and the Salem Connector, Winston Salem Journal, 12 November 2016"). Many thanks to Rising Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church in Happy Hills for welcoming us on that beautiful day.

This print calls for a magnifying glass. It has so many tiny details, like the workmen and news photographers on the bridge deck, trucks and cranes, and background buildings.
