On the day the [Twin Arches](https://www.google.com/search?q=winston+salem+twin+arches&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjH-_2lzPjZAhUCmlkKHcC6CM8Q_AUIDCgD&biw=1221&bih=953) were assembled, my son and I went to the celebration in Happy Hills. There were [a lot of cameras there](http://www.journalnow.com/gallery/twin-arches-are-raised-on-us-and-the-salem-connector/collection_17d436a2-a91d-11e6-a7d3-ab218537acd1.html#7), but we [definitely had the oldest one](http://www.journalnow.com/gallery/twin-arches-are-raised-on-us-and-the-salem-connector/collection_17d436a2-a91d-11e6-a7d3-ab218537acd1.html#15 "Twin Arches are Raised on US 52 and the Salem Connector, Winston Salem Journal, 12 November 2016"). Many thanks to [Rising Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church](https://www.facebook.com/rebc900/) in Happy Hills for welcoming us on that beautiful day.

This print calls for a magnifying glass. It has so many tiny details. There are workmen and news photographers on the bridge deck, cars and trucks everywhere, as well as cranes and background buildings.
