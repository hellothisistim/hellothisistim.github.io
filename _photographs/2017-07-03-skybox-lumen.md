Skybox Lumen, 3 July 2017. 
Scanned lumen print, negative and inverted.

These were made with the skybox pinhole camera, which has a short focal length and is made from bits of lumber picked out of a dumpster.

I made both positive and negative versions of this photograph because I was trying to figure out how I would present my future lumen prints from this camera. Choosing was a challenge. The positive (bottom) is beautiful and easy for photographic laypeople to understand. But the reversed tones and gorgeous colors of the negative (top) proved too seductive.
