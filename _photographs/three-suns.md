Three Suns.

Silver gelatin print on matte fiber paper, selenium toned. First printing. Edition of three plus. 3 1/4" x 3 7/8" on 5 1/4" x 5 7/8" paper.

Print number one of the first printing is available now. $50 includes free shipping via USPS Priority within the US. Please email me for shipping outside the US.

Be advised: this print is a _tiny_ little gem. It probably appears larger on your screen than it does in real life. That said, it would look _awesome_ in an intimate space at your house in an 8-ply mat with a matte black frame.

In my day job I have the pleasure of spending time in a folded-up, glass-sided building where the reflections pile up on each other and it's sometimes unclear what's inside and what's outside. I've been making photographs in it for three years now and I'm still not bored. Also, the architects have left the ductwork exposed for that additional [Miesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe) touch of infractructure as design feature. Sweet!
