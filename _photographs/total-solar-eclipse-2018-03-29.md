Total Solar Eclipse, 29 March 2018.

Digital photograph.

Here's another eclipse for the series. I am pretty much always thinking about making these, but they only seem to actually happen at special times. Like all the previous eclipse photographs, this one is the result of a successful experimentation session. Iâ€™m still learning how to make these happen and it feels somehow appropriate that they only appear when the stars align.
